# twitter.delet0r
Delete all your tweets.

## Prerequisites

 * Install [Python-Twitter](https://github.com/bear/python-twitter)
 * [Register a Twitter-App](https://apps.twitter.com) and allow it to read and write your profile.

## Installation and Usage

 1. `git clone https://github.com/kdungs/twitter.delet0r`
 2. Edit the file `delet0r.py` to include the keys you obtained from Twitter's Apps page.
 3. `python2 delet0r.py`
 4. You might have to repeat step 3 multiple times because Twitter only allows a maximum of 200 statuses per request.
